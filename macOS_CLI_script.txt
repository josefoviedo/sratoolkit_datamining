## first go to the directory where you want to store the SRA files, once there check to see if sratoolkit is installed.

## I use a package manager called Homebrew, and there are others, but for simplicty I will only use this so the syntax for me is as follows:

## this shows me the library of packages in my current environment, if sratoolkit is not listed then it must be installed.
brew list

## this shows me the library of packages in my current environment, if sratoolkit is not listed then it must be installed.
brew install sratoolkit

## since I already have it installed it just outputs a warning saying its there and is up to date.
## next we want to confifure sratoolkit after installing it, you can also use the default config settings if you want.
## this config function opens the config settings
vdb-config --interactive

## after sratoolkit has been configured as desired we can use our previously identified SRA numbers or SRA IDs to extract the sequencing data from the SRA.
## there a couple main functions used to extract data, one is fastq-dump and the other is prefetch which is apparently used for larger size datasets.

## we will be using fastq-dump since it is very straight forward and used relatively small data extraction, per the documentation.
fastq-dump --split-files SRR12345678

## using this function we specified the sequencing data structure using the --split-files flag/argument which indicates that the data is paired-end sequencing data as opposed to single stranded sequencing data.
## the other argument we are specifiying is the SRA ID which is used to search the SRA repository, access the data and extract it to desired destination.

## next check the destination directory to ensure the files have been extracted correctly.
## change the path to the destination you chose since this one is mine.
ls -l /Users/jfoviedo/Code_/zsh-cli/sratoolkit_test1 

## now that we verified the data was extracted successfully we can begin processing it and exploring it to determine if it should be implemented somehow into the main project dataset.

## the sratoolkit application can be repeated or run in parallel if you are extracting sequencing data from various SRA IDs or datasets.

## in future application testing, I am interested in using cloud repositories as the destination rather than to my local machine.
